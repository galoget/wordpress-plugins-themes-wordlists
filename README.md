## Advantages:
- Both wordlists contain a vast number of plugins / themes respectively some of which don't appear on [WordPress Plugin Portal](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). Which makes them really helpful for reconnaissance and enumeration.
- Wordlists will be updated from time to time to maintain them as a useful resource for scanning tools.
- Both wordlists are directly extracted automatically from WordPress SVN Servers. This means not a single line was removed from the results (including the ones with special characters).
